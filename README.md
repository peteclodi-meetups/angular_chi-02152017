# Angular 2 using Typescript, ES 2105/16/17 and ES 5

This is the demo code from a meetup I presented at the Angular Chicago Meetup on 2/15/2017. It covers how to build an Angular 2 app using either Typescript, ES 2015/16/17 or ES 5.

Each language's implementation is in it's own folder, named by the language variant used for development.

Live samples of the code are available at:

[Typescript](http://ng02152017.ts.peteclodi.com)

[ES 2015/16/17](http://ng02152017.es2015.peteclodi.com)

[ES 5](http://ng02152017.es5.peteclodi.com)

A further explanation for each implementation is available in the particular JavaScript flavor's folder.
